mungit
======
Mungit is an MIT licensed [ungit](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit) fork that was triggered by upstream [license change](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit/issues/974). As of 22nd of December 2017, however, the original author decided to [revert ungit back](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit/issues/997) to MIT license ðŸ™Œ ðŸŽ‰

For now, I decided to keep this fork alive mainly for personal use and to act as an alternative flavor of Ungit. Mungit includes some minor differences and additions. Fixes from upstream are merged occasionally based on personal need but the versioning scheme is kept separate.
